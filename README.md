# Projects Overview

This repository contains five independent projects related to formal languages and automata theory. Each project is implemented in a different programming language and serves a unique purpose in the study of computational models.

## Projects List

1. **Grammar.cpp**

   - This project implements a method to check whether a given string can be generated by a specified grammar. The grammar is defined using specific syntax, where variables are enclosed in < >, nullable transitions are denoted by #, and different rules are separated by |.

   - The program outputs "Accepted" if the string is produced by the grammar and "Rejected" otherwise.

2. **Turing Machine.java**

   - This project simulates a Turing Machine, allowing users to define a machine's states, transitions, and input tape. It demonstrates how Turing Machines can compute functions and recognize languages.

3. **Finite Automata.cpp**

   - This project implements a finite automaton (FA) that can process input strings based on defined states and transitions. It can be used to determine whether a given string belongs to the language recognized by the FA.

4. **NFA to DFA.cpp**

   - This project provides a method to convert a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) into an equivalent Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The conversion process includes state elimination and minimization techniques.

5. **DFA Simplification.cpp**

   - This project focuses on simplifying a given DFA by minimizing its states while preserving the language it recognizes. It utilizes algorithms such as state equivalence to achieve this simplification.

## Usage

To utilize any of these projects:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
3. Compile and run the corresponding source code file using an appropriate compiler or runtime environment for the specified language.

## Example for Grammar.cpp

To demonstrate the usage of Grammar.cpp, you can define your grammar and call the method to check a string as follows:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Include your Grammar.cpp implementation here

int main() {
    // Define your grammar here
    // Example: <S> -> <A> | <B> | #
    
    // Call the method to check a string
    string result = checkString(grammarObject, "inputString");
    
    cout << result << endl; // Outputs: Accepted or Rejected
    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

• Make sure to replace "inputString" in the example with an actual string you want to check against the grammar.

• You may also want to include actual code snippets or further details in each project's section if applicable.

• Ensure that any additional files or dependencies required for each project are documented accordingly in their respective sections or in a separate documentation file.
